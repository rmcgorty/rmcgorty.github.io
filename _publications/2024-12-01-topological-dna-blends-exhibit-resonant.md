excerpt: "Blends of circular and linear polymers have fascinated researchers for decades, and the role of topology on their stress response and dynamics remains fervently debated. While linear polymers adopt larger coil sizes and form stronger, more pervasive entanglements than their circular counterparts, threading of circular polymers by linear chains can introduce persistent constraints that dramatically decrease mobility, leading to emergent rheological properties in blends. However, the complex interplay between topology-dependent polymer overlap and threading propensity, along with the large amounts of material required to sample many compositions, has limited the ability to experimentally map stress response to composition with high resolution. Moreover, the role of supercoiling on the response of circular-linear blends remains poorly understood. Here, we leverage in situ enzymatic topological conversion to map the deformation dynamics of DNA blends with over 70 fractions of linear, ring and supercoiled molecules that span the phase space of possible topological compositions. We use OpTiDDM (optical tweezers integrating differential dynamic microscopy) to map strain-induced deformation dynamics to composition, revealing that strain-coupling, quantified by superdiffusive dynamics that are aligned with the strain, is maximized for blends with comparable fractions of ring and linear polymers. Increasing the supercoiled fraction dramatically reduces strain-coupling, while converting rings to linear chains offers more modest coupling reduction. We demonstrate that these results are a direct consequence of the interplay between increasing polymer overlap and decreasing threading probability as circular molecules are converted to linear chains, with a careful balance achieved for blends with ample ring fractions but devoid of supercoiled molecules."
