excerpt: "The cytoskeleton is an active and complex composite network of actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Networks of these distinct biopolymers work in partnership to fulfill fundamental cellular processes, such as cell polarization, intracellular transport, and cell migration. While there is evidence that the different cytoskeletal filaments interact through biochemical signaling and physical interactions, many basic questions remain regarding how this crosstalk impacts the dynamics and organization of the cytoskeletal filaments. Here, we combine Fourier image analysis methods with live cell experiments to characterize the impacts of cytoskeletal crosstalk on the structure and dynamics of microtubules in mouse embryonic fibroblasts."
