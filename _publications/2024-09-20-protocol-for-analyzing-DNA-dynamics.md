excerpt: "Here, we present a protocol for encapsulating DNA molecules under crowded conditions within cell-sized lipid-coated droplets. We describe steps for preparing a lipid-oil mixture and adding an aqueous solution containing DNA, which, when mixed, forms water-in-oil droplets of radii between ∼5 and 100 μm. We then detail procedures for quantifying the dynamics of DNA molecules in these droplets by analyzing fluorescence microscopy time series using differential dynamic microscopy. This protocol can be utilized to investigate DNA transport within a range of biomimetic and crowded environments."
